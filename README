Toolkit to quickly integrate Ajax functionality into a PHP page

An Ajax call triggers a change in the state of an object on the server.
The object is rendered using an HTML template in both the original and new state.
The two results are then compared on the server, and JSON is generated that contains
instructions for morphing the HTML in the original state to the HTML in the new state.
That JSON is returned to the client, where it is interpreted, and the original HTML
is converted into the new HTML.

This is mostly an academic exercise, because the document comparison on the server
is too slow to be practical for complex documents.

The demo "examples/simple/index.php" can be run on an Apache server
with PHP with session cookies enabled.
